\begin{abstract}
In this experiment, we made a 'witch's brew' using frozen beetles which died in the 'Witch's Brew 1' bioassay. 
Sixty-one adult beetles were forced to swim in the slurry for 30 minutes on June 29, 2015. A control group of
59 beetles were forced to swim in water. Beetles were checked weekly.

By July 27, 2015, mortality of the virus treated beetles (75\%) was significantly greater than that of the
control group (48\%). Treatment mortality corrected for experimental control mortality by Abbott's 
formula was 53\%.

Beetles which died in this experiment were preserved and these will be tested for virus if and when additional funding becomes available.

\section*{Methods}

Frozen, dead beetles from previous bioassays were added to one liter of water and made into an aqueous slurry
using a blender. Vials containing remnants of virus samples from AgResearch New Zealand were agitated in 500 ml of 
water, and this suspension was added to the blender. The slurry was poured into a small pail and
forty beetles were made to swim in this for thirty minutes. A control group of beetles was made to swim in water for 
thirty minutes.

Beetles were kept in a large container filled with moist, commercially blended steer manure and soil. 
All beetles were checked weekly. Dead beetles were recorded and frozen.

\section*{Analysis}

Data were analyzed using an IPython notebook (file name = 'witch's brew 2.ipynb'). Significance of differences in mortality
were determined using a Fisher's exact test, and final mortality was adjusted using Abbott's formula.

\section*{Results and Discussion}

Cumulative mortality of virus-treated beetles (75\%) on April 27 (Fig. \ref{mortality}) was significantly greater than that of 
control beetles (48\%); (p = 0.0014; Fisher's exact test). Treatment mortality corrected for experimental control mortality by Abbott's 
formula was 53\%.
